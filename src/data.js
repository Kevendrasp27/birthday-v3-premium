export const specialMessage = `Happy Birthday, Angel! 
You are still just as beautiful as the parts of yourself you sometimes forget.
I’ve seen you in every shade the laughing one, the exhausted one,
the figuring-things-out one, the soft and quiet one and you were lovely in all of them.

I remember the smallest things the most:
the way you say “KV” with that tiny warmth,
your cute “peet dungi!! kya hai!!” mock anger,
your one-of-a-kind typos,
and how you start singing without thinking.

Those are my favorite things about you.
Not big gestures. Not dramatic memories.
Just the raw, real, everyday you.

I only wish this for you:
that your heart feels lighter this year.
That you find peace.
That you meet people who don’t just like you, but truly understand you.

Thank you for crossing paths with my life the way you did.
You’ll always hold a space in my heart and in my story. 🤍`
